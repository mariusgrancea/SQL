-- For this project, I downloaded Netflix Movies data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Netflix Movies data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.NetflixMovies (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
original_title varchar NOT NULL,
year YEAR NOT NULL,
date_published VARCHAR NOT NULL,
genre VARCHAR NOT NULL,
duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
country VARCHAR NOT NULL,
language VARCHAR NOT NULL,
director VARCHAR NOT NULL,
writer VARCHAR NOT NULL,
production_company VARCHAR NOT NULL,
actors LONGTEXT NOT NULL,

avg_vote DECINAL(1,1) NOT NULL,
votes INTEGER NOT NULL,
budget REAL NOT NULL,
usa_gross_income REAL,
worldwide_gross_income REAL,
metascore INTEGER,
user_reviews INTEGER NOT NULL,
critics_reviews INTEGER NOT NULL
